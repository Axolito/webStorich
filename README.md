# webStorich
An ultra-light web page manager for HTML courses

![webStorich Logo](/iconewebStorich.png)

webStorich is a small, unpretentious project aimed at simplifying the management of several small sites in HTML by students.
The simplicity of webStorich makes it possible to show students how it works and to explain what free software is.

## Installation
To install webStorich, simply copy the directory at the root of a PHP-compatible web server and access via a web browser to "config.php". There you have to fill in the database server information and create the administrator account.

## Important
But for the moment webStorich is very... empty and ugly, I'll try to make a version of it almost usable quickly.
