# webStorich
An ultra-light web page manager for HTML courses

webStorich is a small, unpretentious project aimed at simplifying the management of several small sites in HTML by students.
The simplicity of webStorich makes it possible to show students how it works and to explain what free software is.

## Installation
To install webStorich you have to create a database called "webstorich" and follow the instructions in the "config.php" file before editing this one. Copy the directory at the root of a PHP-compatible web server and access via a web browser to "ws_start.php".
Once the administrator account is created, it is recommended to delete this file for security reasons!

## Important
But for the moment webStorich is very... empty and ugly, I'll try to make a version of it almost usable quickly.
